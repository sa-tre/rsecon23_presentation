                            - Variety of approaches
                            - TREs may be fairly bespoke, focused on a particular use or domain
                            - Some community groups to share expertise, coordinate, unify

                            - Existing standards (ISO27001, CE+) do not make your infrastructure a TRE

                            - Collaboration cafés have been the best way to get community input
                            - Breakout room discussions have led directly to significant changes
                              - Recognising the important of information governance
                              - Switch from feature focus to capability focus
                              - Modifying the specification
                              - Adjusting project governance and routes to contribution
                              - Changing evaluation process
                            - You need to prepare in advance. A collaboration café should have an agenda and materials prepared
                            - Facilitators keep discussion on topic, help ensure everyone has their say. Especially when many people attend
                            - After a collaboration café the discussion needs to be summarised and translated into actions
                            - We are proud of the number and diversity of people attending. Active promotion and engagement was very worth the investment
