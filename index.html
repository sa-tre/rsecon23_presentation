                            - Particularly when data subjects are the public, we rely on their trust and consent

                            - Variety of approaches
                            - TREs may be fairly bespoke, focused on a particular use or domain
                            - Some community groups to share expertise, coordinate, unify

                            - Existing standards (ISO27001, CE+) do not make your infrastructure a TRE

                            - Collaboration cafés have been the best way to get community input
                            - Breakout room discussions have led directly to significant changes
                              - Recognising the important of information governance
                              - Switch from feature focus to capability focus
                              - Modifying the specification
                              - Adjusting project governance and routes to contribution
                              - Changing evaluation process
                            - You need to prepare in advance. A collaboration café should have an agenda and materials prepared
                            - Facilitators keep discussion on topic, help ensure everyone has their say. Especially when many people attend
                            - After a collaboration café the discussion needs to be summarised and translated into actions
                            - We are proud of the number and diversity of people attending. Active promotion and engagement was very worth the investment

                            - An open project means
                              - People can see and comment on your work in progress
                              - There are clear routes to contribution
                            - You should start open, from the first contribution
                              - Good practice from the beginning
                              - Clear distinction between public and private (e.g. survey)
                              - Making a project open later is difficult
                            - Contribution process, code of conduct _etc._ helps people to contribute
                            - Codifying this takes time. It is OK to be good enough and change your processes when there is a need

                              - collaboration is easier when there is a specific task
                              - masking the most of limited time
                              - strategic collaboration matters

                        <ul>

                            <li>You must make <span class="highlight">good use</span> of people's time</li>
                            <li>The "project team" should engage with the collaboration process too</li>
                            <li>Roles like PIE, community managers, RAMs have the <span class="highlight">skills and enthusiasm</span> to engage people</li>

                            - Our initial approach was "participant-driven", asking attendees what they wanted to talk about at events
                                - It was difficult for us to keep focus and it was difficult for collaborators to know how they could help
                                - Moved to preparing focused events, asking specific questions
                                - More productive and clear when our approach is not aligned with the community
                            - Time is limited, particularly when engaging with the public
                                - They are not paid to help us, we must respect their time and not waste it
                                - Focus on short and direct engagements with clear goals
                                - Don't expect people to devote time or be engaged over long periods
                            - Your "core team" should be active and visible at collaboration events
                                - It is important to avoid an "us and them" perception
                            - Roles focused on community and engagement have been critical
                                - They bring expertise and a desire to do work RSEs (or other tech focused roles) lack

                            - Wasted effort
                              - Trying to produce complete items without feedback
                              - Finding that what we had done was not right
                            - For example the survey
                              - Around two months to create, share, analyse, process results
                              - We are proud, > 100 responses
                              - Strong feedback that survey wasn't particularly helpful, asking wrong questions, wrong focus
                            - Now we take advantage of version control and open working to get feedback earlier
                              - Open discussion about ideas early
                              - Propose changes and ask for feedback
                              - Use collaboration cafés to show what we are working on and improve
                              - More comfortable committing 'draft' items to development branch (releases remain)
                            - Community feedback leads to many, sometimes large changes
                            - Overall it saves effort as we do not invest in the wrong things
