                          - Recognising the important of information governance
                          - Switch from feature focus to capability focus

                          - Changing evaluation process
                        - You need to prepare in advance. A collaboration café should have an agenda and materials prepared
                        - After a collaboration café the discussion needs to be summarised and translated into actions
                        - Facilitators keep discussion on topic, help ensure everyone has their say. Especially when many people attend
                        - We are proud of the number and diversity of people attending. Active promotion and engagement was very worth the investment

                        - Codifying this takes time. It is OK to be good enough and change your processes when there is a need

                        - Public bring valuable contributions that your "technical" team won't make
                        - PIE professionals know how to explain your work and make sure it is heard
                        - Public team members
                            - Ensure voice is heard
                            - Must be treated equally
                        - Recruiting the public is challenging
                            - Different commitments, childcare, work, holidays, caring
                            - Lack of clear incentive to contribute
                            - It takes thought and effort to engage

                        <li>105 <span class="highlight">survey</span> responses from 55 organisations</li>
                        <li>Could have been <span class="highlight">more effective</span></li>
                        <li>Take advantage of <span class="highlight">version control</span> and <span class="highlight">open working</span></li>

                    <aside data-markdown class="notes">
                        - Wasted effort
                          - Trying to produce complete items without feedback
                          - Finding that what we had done was not right
                        - For example the survey
                          - Around two months to create, share, analyse, process results
                          - We are proud
                          - 105 responses, 55 organisations
                          - Strong feedback that survey wasn't particularly helpful, asking wrong questions, wrong focus
                        - Now we take advantage of version control and open working to get feedback earlier
                          - Open discussion about ideas early
                          - Propose changes and ask for feedback
                          - Use collaboration cafés to show what we are working on and improve
                          - More comfortable committing 'draft' items to development branch (releases remain)
                        - Community feedback leads to many, sometimes large changes
                        - Overall it saves effort as we do not invest in the wrong things

                        - There is a need for better standardisation in TREs
                        - We need community consensus and buy in for this to work
                        - We thought hard about how to achieve this
                        - We designed the project to enable this
                            - We have learned from mistakes
                            - Willing to make changes
                            - We learned what works particular well
                        - We encourage any project to adopt what worked well whenever community involvement is important
