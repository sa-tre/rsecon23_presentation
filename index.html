                        - Collaboration cafés have been the best way to get community input
                        - Breakout room discussions have led directly to significant changes
                          - Recognising the important of information governance
                          - Switch from feature focus to capability focus
                          - Modifying the specification
                          - Adjusting project governance and routes to contribution
                          - Changing evaluation process
                        - You need to prepare in advance. A collaboration café should have an agenda and materials prepared
                        - After a collaboration café the discussion needs to be summarised and translated into actions
                        - Facilitators keep discussion on topic, help ensure everyone has their say. Especially when many people attend
                        - We are proud of the number and diversity of people attending. Active promotion and engagement was very worth the investment

                        - An open project means
                          - People can see and comment on your work in progress
                          - There are clear routes to contribution
                        - You should start open, from the first contribution
                          - Good practice from the beginning
                          - Clear distinction between public and private (e.g. survey)
                          - Making a project open later is difficult
                        - Contribution process, code of conduct _etc._ helps people to contribute
                        - Codifying this takes time. It is OK to be good enough and change your processes when there is a need

                        - Our initial approach was "participant-driven", asking attendees what they wanted to talk about at events
                            - It was difficult for us to keep focus and it was difficult for collaborators to know how they could help
                            - Moved to preparing focused events, asking specific questions
                            - More productive and clear when our approach is not aligned with the community
                        - Time is limited, particularly when engaging with the public
                            - They are not paid to help us, we must respect their time and not waste it
                            - Focus on short and direct engagements with clear goals
                            - Don't expect people to devote time or be engaged over long periods
                        - Your "core team" should be active and visible at collaboration events
                            - It is important to avoid an "us and them" perception
                        - Roles focused on community and engagement have been critical
                            - They bring expertise and a desire to do work RSEs (or other tech focused roles) lack

                          - We are proud, > 100 responses
                          - Strong feedback that survey wasn't particularly helpful, asking wrong questions, wrong focus
                        - Now we take advantage of version control and open working to get feedback earlier
                          - Open discussion about ideas early
                          - Propose changes and ask for feedback
                          - Use collaboration cafés to show what we are working on and improve
                          - More comfortable committing 'draft' items to development branch (releases remain)
                        - Community feedback leads to many, sometimes large changes
                        - Overall it saves effort as we do not invest in the wrong things
