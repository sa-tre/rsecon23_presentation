## Abstract

SATRE — Standardised Architecture for Trusted Research Environments — is a multi-institutional project developing and implementing a reference specification for trusted research environments (TREs) using an open, collaborative approach.

Personal or sensitive data which has been collected for operational, commercial or governmental reasons need to be managed securely and safely in a trusted environment that encourages best practice.
However, most TREs are developed independently by siloed teams, resulting in TREs that are incompatible with each other, and aren't conducive to collaborative research.

By making a standardised reference specification openly available, the SATRE team is working to break down these siloes and facilitate ground-breaking research with sensitive data across domains and industries.

A standard approach can work only if it has widespread support.
The specification is openly developed through an extensive stakeholder engagement plan that goes beyond technically minded operators and developers, and includes the general public as well as high-level commissioners.
Setting up open collaborative spaces, and actively reaching out to the community and the public, is critical for the success and sustainability of the project.

As we approach the end of our funding window, we will present our achievements and progress, including:

- Building and formalising the specification with multi-stakeholder input
- Developing standards in the open
- Achieving community engagement and consensus
- Managing cross-institution collaborations
- Ensuring the continuation of engagement and contribution beyond the project

We will also highlight how the RSE community can continue to contribute to the project and influence the future of how sensitive data are used with TREs!
